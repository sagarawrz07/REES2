	there are different markets... some markets dont get stimulated 

inequality 


the market dont exist in a void, there is always goverment 

inequality of access/o[[ortunities or output... 


vertical inequitiens.... hierarchy... individuals individuals: class wealth skill, job position 
horizontal inequities: unequal access to political economic social resources by different cultural ethnic religious gorups 

categorical inequalites, 
asymetrical relations 

eploitation and opportunity hoarding 
emulation and adaptation .... reinforeces categorical distictions 

material deprivaitons and discrimination 

waht to focuse... first address the tension ? lets say convfitl between ethnic groups 

if you solve hte material deprivation you solve the other things 
same access to opprotunities (not political), outcomes are different... when compared to global even more....
